# hanoi

Simple TUI Tower of Hanoi problem visualizer written in C. Plans to also write in RISCV ASM and Haskell for comparison.

## Features

Does the Tower of Hanoi problem for 5 toruses.

## TODO:
- [X] Implement the algorithm for n toruses
- [ ] Implement CLI args to choose arbitrary n
- [ ] Implement the program in RISCV ASM
- [ ] Implement the program in Haskell
